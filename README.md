# Data-Viz-Exercise-1
March 2017

This is my first assignment for Springboard's Foundations of Data Science Exploratory Data Analysis unit. In this exercise, I used the titanic database and created three plots visualizing chances of survival on the Titanic. I used the framework suggested by Datacamp's Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1).
